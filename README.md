vertical tabs with tree structure and bells n whistles 


VIP 

this will be my personal replacement for tree style tabs ... i already have a version running on quantum 65 but this one is still for waterfox.. 

its not 100% fleshed out and sometime the tree doesnt behave like i want to, also not all features and controlls are implemented yet ... its not really BUGGY(like in crashing firefox or ceasiong to work) but behaviour is not always consistant, its already usable though 


implemented:
- vertical tabs 
- tree structure
-tab preview
-session restore for tabpreview and indentfactor
-better new tab button
-ctrl+alt+arrowkeys left/right = (un)indent tab and subtree 



todo:

-consistant tab opening in ascending order from any new tab source 
-tab back n forth history counter
-lock button on tab
-memo button on tab + memo system (just a crude text editor in a popup) + implement with session restore 
- bring sound icon to the left , group with other buttons 

- optimized startup (right now you must restart after intstall )
